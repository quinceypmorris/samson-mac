<p>i would promise to not use too many shakespeare quotes but that would be speaking too soon. the bard haunts me..</p>
<p> im still hung up on my lear production from march. i dont like playing women but if u play a woman it may as well be goneril </p>

<p> i may be losing my mind (old news). </p>
<p> theres a STEC (bad e.coli) outbreak in the uk right now and over 60% of known cases have resulted in hospitalisation. e coli is one of my biggest fears. </p>

<p> as a kid i had Bad kidney issues so if i get this im fucked. im meant to be playing pathfinder tomorrow and im trying not to cancel. i cant have anyone touching me. </p>

<p> the worst thing about being insane is the way people look at you when you explain. it doesn't make sense. thats what makes it insanity. </p>
<p> i often wonder what makes life worth living if im terrified every moment of it. </p>
